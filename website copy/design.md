First I designed the navbar, I decided to implement bootstraps navbars and customized it slightly. Its contained in a div container which is seperated into two parts, one containing my initials in the top left corner along with a link. The other part is a an unordered list which utitlizes the bootstrap nav bar classes. I set the list items classes to active to create the blue filled borders around the text. 

After the navbar, I seperated each section with the <section> element and created an id for them so they could be accessed with css. 

For the Home section, I used a div to store the primary content. Within  this div contains my portrait image, a heading and text under the heading. Each element except the img within the div is animated. I used animate.style to create the animations and used their custom attributes to adjust these animations as needed. 
I used a linear gradient background to create an appealing an modern image of for the website and implemented shadows behind the text too.
 

The about sections design utilizes a main container which stores each key part within the about section. 
It has the heading, and a div that contains the content details. I also used an anchor link to transport the user to the contact section under the details. On the right side, contains the skills which is placed within another div specifically for the skills and a bunch of individual divs to create each skill block. 

The project section consists of a main container div, a heading, and 3 sections for each project listed within the section. To implement a new project, copy and paste previous project__content section. Within the content sections, contain rows to seperate the image, and project desc. Skills are also listed at bottom of page as well as a live link and code link which is created by a custom button class btn btn--med btn--theme.

The Contact section utilizes forms to request Name, Email, and a Message. Each field is seperated by divs with custom css classes I created within the style.css file. Each field is required so that you cannot submit until each field is filled out.

CSS

The css file is entirely customized to support any device. Each part of website is fully responsive. CSS controls every item except animations and navbar. @media only screen and used for each class created to adjust widths of mediaqueries so that website is properly displayed at all resolutions.
